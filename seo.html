  <h1>My SEO Skills</h1>

  <p>As a content editor at <strong><a href="https://zimamagazine.com" target="_blank">Zima Magazine</a></strong> from 2017 to 2020, I implemented a range of SEO practices to enhance our online reach among the Russian-speaking community in London. My efforts in keyword integration, content structure, and strategic CTAs contributed to improved engagement and search visibility.</p>

  <h2>Improving Visibility through Keyword Integration</h2>
  <p>By strategically placing <span class="highlight">keywords</span> in titles, headers, and body text, and crafting concise, keyword-rich meta descriptions, I boosted our click-through rates.</p>

  <h2>Enhancing Content Structure for Readability</h2>
  <p>To make our content easier to read and more engaging, I optimised for readability with short paragraphs, headers, and bullet points, which reduced bounce rates and improved user experience.</p>

  <h2>Optimising Images and Links for SEO</h2>
  <p>Using descriptive <span class="highlight">alt text</span> for images and integrating internal and external links not only improved SEO but also provided readers with valuable resources, increasing the siteâ€™s authority.</p>

  <h2>Encouraging Engagement through Calls-to-Action (CTAs)</h2>
  <p>To retain readers and improve engagement, I incorporated strategic CTAs, which increased on-page time and boosted engagement metrics significantly.</p>

  <h2>Keeping Content Fresh and Relevant</h2>
  <p>Regularly updating articles ensured they stayed relevant to readers and maintained strong search rankings, helping Zima Magazine retain its competitive position.</p>

  <h2>Using Local SEO and Analytics for Targeted Engagement</h2>
  <p>For our London-based audience, I optimised content with <span class="highlight">local keywords</span> and used analytics to refine our strategy, making data-driven adjustments to improve our visibility and reader engagement.</p>

  <p>This experience demonstrated the power of well-executed SEO in reaching and engaging niche audiences, skills I continue to refine in my current work.</p>
